## Definitions

Assume the following general case. $$N$$ test subjexts respond to a prompt, each jotting down a different number of responses. Let $$t \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}$$ be a test subject, each of whom produces $$j_{t}$$ "jots." (In the example of a DT task, jots would be individual responses. More generally, jots can be any individuated state or response. In the example of a game with descrete game states, jots would be those states.) Thus, $$R_{t,j}$$ is the j^^th jot produced by the t^^th test subject.

$$R$$ is the set of all responses $$\{R_{1,1}, R_{1,2}, ... , R_{1,j_{1}}, R_{2,1}, ..., R_{N,j_{N}}\}$$. The count of this set we call the _total mass_ of responses. We further define _frequency_ as the number of times a jot appears in $$R$$.

Our uniqueness measure is built from a few basic principles of how we define uniqueness:
1) Within a given response set $$R$$, all jots that have the same frequency are equally unique
2) Within a given response set $$R$$, jots that have a lower frequency are more unique than jots that have a higher frequency
3) Across response sets, uniqueness increases as total mass increases for jots at at fixed frequency

Suppose the context for this measure is a DT task. $$R_{t,j}$$ is a response to a prompt, perhaps it is "paperweight" in response to "think of all the possible uses for a brick." If paperweight is given by 25 participants, then the frequency of the jot "paperweight" is 25. 
1) If the jot "doorstop" was also given by 25 participants, then "doorstop" and "paperweight" have the same score.
2) If the jot "build a house" was given by 30 participants, and "the saddest balloon ever" was given by 1 participant, then "build a house" has a lower score than "paperweight", which in turn has a lower score than "the saddest balloon ever."
3) If "paperweight" was given by 25 participants in response sets with total masses of 200 and 100, then it has a higher score in the former set.

These three principles
