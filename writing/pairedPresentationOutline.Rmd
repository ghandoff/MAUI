## Presentation Outline
1. Standard definition suggests that we look for both novelty and usefulness
    + approaches to orignality
      - not in the most common list (TTCT)
      - Statistical infrequency
      - consensual assessment (Amabile)
        * Individual Ideas
        * Ideational Pool
    + usefulness is personal
2. Research Questions
    + How does the originality of ideas fluctuate during DT?
    + Can we provide more information about the creativity of an individual?
    + How else can we observe children's creativity?
3. Revising the Uniqueness Index
    + Its usefulness
      - less subjective
      - thresholds create dichotomous tally to compare with other indices (fluency, flexibility)
    + Its issues
      - unclear reasoning behind thresholds
      - overestimating originality
      - resulting tallies are highly correlated with fluency
    + MAUI
      - acknowledging levels as unit of analysis
      - distribution of ideas are attributed to item prompt
4. Process Analyses
    + Continuous MAUI
      - _how_ original is an idea?
    + Ideational Profiles
      - revisiting the "order effect"
      - Discriminating different approaches/strategies
    + Shift Strategy >> episodic divergence
      - adding granularity to divergence after lexical shifts
5. Exploratory Play
    + Curiosity and learning
    + Affordances
    + Troubleshooting and persistence
6. Reflections on the Advancements and Flexibility of MAUI
    + A better UI
    + Profile as additional perpective
    + Any prompt will do...
    + Reduced number of prompts
