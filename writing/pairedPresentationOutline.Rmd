1. Intro
    + Looking for novelty and usefulness (Runco & Jaeger)
      - approaches to orignality
        * not in the most common list (TTCT)
        * Statistical infrequency
        * consensual assessment (Amabile)
          + Individual Ideas
          + Ideational Pool (Runco)
      - usefulness is personally meaningful
        * _not_ the focus of our studies
    + Outcomes and Process
      - From assessment to behavioral coding (Bonawitz et al)
      - Developmental methodologies (Adolph)
    + Research Questions
      - How does the originality of ideas fluctuate during DT?
      - Can we provide more information about the creativity of an individual?
      - How else can we observe children's creativity?
2. Revising the Uniqueness Index
    + Its usefulness
      - Less subjective
      - Thresholds create dichotomous tally to compare with other indices (fluency, flexibility)
    + Its issues
      - Unclear reasoning behind thresholds
      - Sample dependency
      - Overestimating originality
      - Resulting tallies are highly correlated with fluency
    + MAUI
      - Acknowledging levels as unit of analysis
        * Response
        * Item
        * Individual
        * Sample
      - Non-parametric rank distribution density of ideas attributed to item prompt
        * approach similar to Item Response Theory, where score represents the participant's ability and the item difficulty
      - Marketplace of ideas
        * identifying the best ideas
3. Process Analyses
    + Continuous MAUI
      - _how_ original is an idea?
    + Ideational Profiles
      - revisiting the "order effect" (Torrance; Silvia et al)
      - Discriminating different approaches/strategies
    + Shift Strategy >> episodic divergence
      - adding granularity to divergence after lexical shifts (Acar & Runco)
4. Exploratory Play
    + Curiosity and learning (Legare & Lombrowski)
    + Affordances
    + Troubleshooting and persistence
5. Reflections on the Advancements and Flexibility of MAUI
    + A better UI
    + Profile as additional perpective
    + Any prompt will do...
    + Reduced number of prompts
