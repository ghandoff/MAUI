The files in this .zip-archive constitute the election data for APA elections in 1998-2009. The work that analyzed this data was supported by National Science Foundation grants SES # 08-20009, ICES # 1216016 (PI: M. Regenwetter), the University Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (PI: A. Popova), and the Basic Research Program at HSE (S. Popov). We thank the American Psychological Association for permitting access to its election ballot data. The original files were posted on https://sites.google.com/site/sergeyvpopov/papers/social-choice

The data has following format:

candidate A	candidate B	candidate C	candidate D	candidate E	# voters
5		4		3		2		1		29
5		4		3		1		2		67
5		4		2		3		1		37
0		1		2		3		0		10


First 5 columns contain candidate ranks, the last column has a number of voters who reported this preference structure. For example, first row of the table above means that 29 voters ranked candidate A 5th (lowest rank), candidate B 4th, candidate C 3rd, candidate E - first (highest rank).

Zero in a row means that the candidate's rank was not reported by voters. For example, last row in the table above means that 10 voters ranked candidate B first, candidate C second, candidate D third, and did not state any preferences (didn't give a rank) for candidates A and E.
